        <p>
          Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and began to work as a
          sports broadcaster in Iowa. He moved to California in 1937, and became
          a well-known film actor there. Reagan twice served as the president of
          the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952 and from 1959 to 1960.
          During the 1950s, he worked in television and spoke for General
          Electric. Reagan's "A Time for Choosing" speech during the 1964
          presidential campaign elevated him as a new conservative figure. He
          was elected governor of California in 1966. During his governorship,
          he raised taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus, and
          cracked down harshly on university protests. After challenging and
          losing to incumbent president Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican
          presidential primaries, Reagan won the Republican nomination and then
          a landslide victory over incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter
          in the 1980 presidential election. In his first term, Reagan
          implemented "Reaganomics", which involved economic deregulation and
          cuts in both taxes and government spending during a period of
          stagflation. He escalated an arms race and transitioned Cold War
          policy away from détente with the Soviet Union. Reagan also ordered
          the invasion of Grenada in 1983. Additionally, he survived an
          assassination attempt, fought public-sector labor unions, expanded the
          war on drugs, and was slow to respond to the AIDS epidemic in the
          United States, which began early in his presidency. In the 1984
          presidential election, he defeated Carter's vice president Walter
          Mondale in another landslide victory. Foreign affairs dominated
          Reagan's second term, including the 1986 bombing of Libya, the
          Iran–Iraq War, the secret and illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the
          Contras, and a more conciliatory approach in talks with Soviet leader
          Mikhail Gorbachev that culminated in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
          Forces Treaty. Reagan left the presidency in 1989 with the American
          economy having seen a significant reduction of inflation, the
          unemployment rate having fallen, and the United States having entered
          its then-longest peacetime expansion. At the same time, the national
          debt had nearly tripled since 1981 as a result of his cuts in taxes
          and increased military spending, despite cuts to domestic
          discretionary spending. Reagan's policies also contributed to the end
          of the Cold War and the end of Soviet communism.[7] Alzheimer's
          disease hindered Reagan post-presidency, and his physical and mental
          capacities rapidly deteriorated, ultimately leading to his death in
          2004. Historians and scholars have typically ranked him among the
          middle to upper tier of American presidents, and his post-presidential
          approval ratings by the general public are usually high.[8]

          Reagan led a new conservative movement, altering the political dynamic
          of the United States.[405] Conservatism became the dominant ideology
          for Republicans, displacing the party's faction of liberals and
          moderates.[406] In his time, men began voting more Republican, and
          women began voting more Democrat – a gender distinction that has
          persisted.[405] He was supported by young voters, an allegiance that
          shifted many of them to the party.[407] He attempted to appeal to
          black voters in 1980,[408] but would receive the lowest black vote for
          a Republican presidential candidate at the time.[409] Throughout
          Reagan's presidency, Republicans were unable to gain complete control
          of Congress.[410] The period of American history most dominated by
          Reagan and his policies (particularly on taxes, welfare, defense, the
          federal judiciary, and the Cold War) is known as the Reagan era, which
          suggests that the "Reagan Revolution" had a lasting impact on the
          United States in domestic and foreign policy. The Clinton
          administration is often treated as an extension of the era, as is the
          George W. Bush administration.[411] Since 1988, Republican
          presidential candidates have invoked Reagan's policies and
          beliefs.[412]
